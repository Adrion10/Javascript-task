## The Temperature Converter
It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

Create a function called `celsiusToFahrenheit`:

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN°C is NN°F".

Create a function called `fahrenheitToCelsius`:

- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN°F is NN°C."

```
°C to °F:   Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32

°F to °C:   Subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
```

## The Puppy Age Calculator

You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

-   Write a function named  `calculateDogAge`  that:
    -   takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
    -   calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
    -   outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
-   Call the function three times with different sets of values.
-   **Bonus**: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

## Palindrome

Write a function `isPalindrome` to check whether a word is a palindrome or not. Note: a palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or tarrattarrat


## Merge Arrays 

Create a function that will merge two arrays and return the result as a new array

**Bonus** Create a function that will receive two arrays of numbers as arguments and return an array composed of all the numbers that are either in the first array or second array but not in both

**Bonus**

## Sum of Comma Separeted Values (CVS)
Calculate the sum of numbers received in a comma delimited string
```
sumCSV("1.5, 2.3, 3.1, 4, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.9")
```
