# Program - Summary

## Overview

Reading a program is an acquired skill, and the best way to understand execution is to think like a computer. This sub module introduces learners to various scope, decisions and flow control concepts in JavaScript.

### Objectives

By the end of this sub module, learners should be able to:

- Understand and visualize control flow and the way a program is read by a computer
- Explain what an algorithm is and how it is used in the context of programming
- Analyze common logical problems and write algorithms to solve these problems
- Understand code blocks and variable scope
- Use conditional statements in JavaScript to execute different code blocks depending on boolean expression values
- Use loops in JavaScript to execute a code block several times numerically or depending on a condition
- Identify and correct conditional and loop based syntax and scope errors
